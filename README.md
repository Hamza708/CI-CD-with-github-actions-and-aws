# Project Overview

This repository contains two branches, each focusing on a different deployment approach for Node.js applications:

- **ECS-ECR**: This branch demonstrates deploying Node.js applications with AWS Fargate ECS (Elastic Container Service) and ECR (Elastic Container Registry) using GitHub Actions.
- **EC2-LB-ASG**: This branch showcases deploying applications on EC2 instances using GitHub Actions, Docker Compose, and Load Balancer / Auto Scaling Groups.

## Branch: ECS-ECR

### Deploying Node.js Applications with AWS Fargate ECS and ECR
