# Deploying Node.js Applications with AWS Fargate ECS and ECR

Welcome to the AWS Fargate ECS and ECR Node.js Project repository! This project is designed to help you deploy your Node.js application seamlessly on AWS Fargate using ECS (Elastic Container Service) and ECR (Elastic Container Registry). We've included GitHub Actions workflows to automate the build, push, and deployment processes, making it easier for you to manage your infrastructure.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, please ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/): Docker is required to build and manage your container images.
- [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed to manage your Node.js application dependencies.
- [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions): GitHub Actions will be used to automate the deployment workflow.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Clone Repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git

2. **Install Dependencies:**

3. **Create ECR Repository:**
Create an ECR repository for your Docker images using the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI.

4. **Update GitHub Secrets:**
Add your AWS credentials (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) and ECR repository URL as secrets in your GitHub repository settings.

5. **Update Task Definition:**
Update the `task-definition.json` file with your container configuration and environment variables.

6. **Configure GitHub Actions Workflow:**
Configure the GitHub Actions workflow (`/.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to build your Docker image, push it to ECR, and deploy it to ECS.

## Usage

Follow these steps to build and deploy your Node.js application to AWS Fargate ECS:

1. **Push Changes:**
Push changes to your GitHub repository.

2. **Trigger Workflow:**
GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow defined in `/github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

3. **Monitor Execution:**
Monitor the workflow execution in the Actions tab of your GitHub repository.

4. **Deployment Completion:**
Once the workflow completes successfully, your application will be deployed to AWS Fargate ECS.
